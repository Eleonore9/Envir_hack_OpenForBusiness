What is it?

An application started at Digital Catapult's Environmental Data Exchange hackathon.


Our idea

Businesses are being individuals in their involvement with sustainability.
We want to gather (open) data on businesses sustainability to assess the progress being made.

How does it work
---
Currently it takes data from Amee api. Amee calculates a sustainability score for companies.
We clean data and visualise the scores on a dashboard.
